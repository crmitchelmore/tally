# Copilot Instructions (Tally)

Use this philosophy in all product work:
- Tactile: interactions feel like marking paper; clear visual feedback.
- Focused: minimal UI; numbers and progress are central.
- Honest: no gimmicks; show real progress and pace.

Principles to uphold:
- Friendly, playful, fast, and calm.
- Progressive disclosure; reduce cognitive load.
- Subtle motion with reduced-motion support.
- Accessible, high-contrast, readable type and large tap targets.
- Offline-first mindset with clear sync states.
