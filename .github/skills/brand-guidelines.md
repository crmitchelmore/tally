# Skill: brand-guidelines

Purpose: keep visuals aligned with Tally's brand and design philosophy.

Use when:
- designing UI, marketing, or visual assets

Guidelines:
- Tactile: ink-like strokes, tally marks, clear feedback.
- Focused: minimal UI, numbers and progress are central.
- Honest: no gimmicks; progress is raw and real.
- Calm + friendly: subtle motion, no noisy effects.
- One warm accent color on a neutral base; subtle tally texture.
