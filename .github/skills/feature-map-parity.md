# Skill: feature-map-parity

Purpose: ensure scope matches feature-map.md and parity across platforms.

Use when:
- planning or implementing web, iOS, Android, or landing features
- deciding what is in or out of scope

Checklist:
- Map each deliverable to a feature-map section.
- Call out known gaps (public challenge totals, leaderboard aggregation).
- Keep API endpoints aligned with docs/API.md.
- Preserve cross-cutting UX requirements (performance, accessibility).
