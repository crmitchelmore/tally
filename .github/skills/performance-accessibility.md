# Skill: performance-accessibility

Purpose: keep Tally fast, calm, and accessible.

Use when:
- adding UI motion, media, or interactivity
- implementing key flows or landing page sections

Checklist:
- Target instant response (tap -> feedback).
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion; avoid large animations.
- Maintain high contrast, readable type, and large tap targets.
- Avoid heavy hero JS; lazy-load media and pause offscreen.
- Provide clear offline or slow-network states.
