# Tally — Design Style Notes (raw)

> Captured as spoken notes; intentionally unrefined.

- Lean into **platform-native patterns** for each surface (iOS native, Android native, Web native).
- Core tenets: **speed** and **responsiveness** — touches/actions should feel immediate.
- Add **delight** via “cool animations” that feel good, but stay **classy** (not cringey).
- The **tally mark** (four vertical lines + diagonal cross for five) is the foundation of the visual identity.
- Need a foundational design for **rolling tallies up** into larger counts so it still makes sense at higher numbers.
  - Initially: focus on **visual display** of rolled-up tallies.
  - Later: could become a way of presenting/scaling counts, but prioritize visuals first.
- Color direction:
  - White “paper” is the default, but pure white may not work well enough.
  - Consider a **slightly off-white**, papery background (not yellow).
  - For the “add” picker: start with tally marks on a white background, but that may evolve.
