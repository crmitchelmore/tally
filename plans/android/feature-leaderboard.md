# Feature: Leaderboard (Android)

> **Out of scope (for now):** We do **not** ship leaderboards or rankings.
> Keep community as follow/share-only; followed challenges appear on a personal dashboard.


## Status
**Deferred.** We explicitly avoid public ranking mechanics while we establish the core habit + community follow model.

## Keep instead
- Community: public challenges, follow/unfollow.
- Followed challenges appear on the user’s personal dashboard.

## Design philosophy integration
- Tactile: immediate feedback with ink-like motion and haptics where available.
- Focused: primary action is obvious; progressive disclosure for details.
- Honest: real totals and pace; no gamified noise.
- Friendly/fast/calm: subtle motion, reduced-motion support, large tap targets.
- Offline-first: local writes with clear sync state and retry.
