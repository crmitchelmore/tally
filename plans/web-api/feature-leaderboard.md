# Feature: Leaderboard (web)

> **Out of scope (for now):** We do **not** ship leaderboards or rankings.
> Keep community as follow/share-only; followed challenges appear on a personal dashboard.


## Status
**Deferred.** We explicitly avoid public ranking mechanics while we establish the core habit + community follow model.

## Keep instead
- Community: public challenges, follow/unfollow.
- Followed challenges appear on the user’s personal dashboard.

## Design philosophy integration
- Tactile: immediate feedback on actions (optimistic UI, crisp motion).
- Focused: primary action is prominent; progressive disclosure for secondary details.
- Honest: real counts and pace; no gamified noise.
- Friendly/fast/calm: subtle motion, reduced-motion support, readable contrast.
- Offline-first: clear sync state for queued writes and retries.
