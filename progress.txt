## Decisions Made

### Access Control
- All design tokens marked as `public` for cross-module access
- Extension syntax: `public extension Color` for cleaner API
- TallyMarkView is public for app consumption

### Color Token Implementation
- Used Color(uiColor: UIColor { traits in ... }) pattern for light/dark support
- OKLCH approximations using RGB values
- Three-color system: C1 (tallyInk), C2 (tallyInkSecondary), C3 (tallyInkTertiary)
- Warm red accent (tallyAccent) for 5th tally mark slash

### GraphicsContext Approach
- SwiftUI Canvas with GraphicsContext (not CGContext)
- Used `var context` with `translateBy` for coordinate transforms
- No saveGState/restoreGState - create new context copies instead
- Direct path drawing with context.stroke() API

### Fractal Completion Implementation
- Complete implementation of 1-10,000+ range
- Cap overlays appear only at exact thresholds (25, 100, 1000, 10000)
- Color cycling: C1 → C2 → C3 → C1... for nested levels
- Simplified representation at high counts to maintain clarity

### Animation & Accessibility
- Reduce Motion environment variable checked
- VoiceOver labels with meaningful count descriptions
- Dynamic Type support via font tokens
- Motion tokens with platform-appropriate durations (120-420ms)

### App Architecture
- TabView for primary navigation (Home, Community)
- NavigationStack (not deprecated NavigationView)
- Paper background (Color.tallyPaper) as base layer
- SyncStatusView as floating overlay indicator

## Build Output
```
** BUILD SUCCEEDED **

```

## Next Steps (Future Work)
1. Add snapshot tests for TallyMarkView thresholds
2. Implement settings/theme toggle
3. Add local data persistence
4. Implement sync logic
5. Create challenge/counter models
6. Add detail navigation flows
7. Implement Dynamic Type testing at all sizes
8. VoiceOver audit with Accessibility Inspector
