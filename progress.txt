BLOCKED: CD (landing + /app) cannot start because repo has no web/landing code or build tooling (no package.json/Next.js app), so there is nothing to deploy yet.
BLOCKED: CD workflow also requires Vercel project + prod domain configuration and GitHub Actions secrets (VERCEL_API_TOKEN, optional VERCEL_ORG_ID/VERCEL_PROJECT_ID) which need external setup.
No verification commands exist yet for this item because there is no web code or build tooling in the repo.
Next: initialize web/landing app per tech-stack-requirements.md (Next.js + Bun) so deployment workflow can be added.
